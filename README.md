# lbt-honeybee

Collection of all Honeybee core Python libraries.

Note that this repository and corresponding Python package does not contain any
code and it simply exists to provide a shortcut for installing all of the honeybee
core libraries together.

## Included Honeybee Extensions

Running `pip install lbt-honeybee` will result in the installation of the following
honeybee Python packages:

* [honeybee-radiance](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-radiance)
* [honeybee-radiance-folder](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-radiance-folder)
* [honeybee-radiance-command](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-radiance-command)
* [honeybee-energy](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-energy)
* [honeybee-energy-standards](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-energy-standards)

## Included Honeybee Core Libraries

Since both honeybee extensions use the honeybee core libraries, the following
dependencies are also included:

* [honeybee-core](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-core)
* [honeybee-schema](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-schema)

## All Ladybug Packages Are Also Included
